Vim Syntax file for Monkey C (Garmin Connect IQ)

These are the Vim syntax files I used to develop Garmin ConnectIQ applications (but imcomplete yet).
I used to use vim/bash/SDK to develop ConnectIQ apps, as my Mac is too old to use Eclipse.
Since ConnectIQ SDK is available for Linux, so probably I will migrate the IQ dev. environment to there
and use vim/bash environment again.
